# Book Site

This repo contains code for a website focused on books I have read
and is an excuse to learn some React.

## Pre-requisites

To develop this site, need to have `npm` installed and `node` version 18.
The package was creaed with `npx create-react-app`.

We also use python 3.10 to develop the python script which manages
our database (a json file) of books.

## Run the website

To run the website:

```bash
cd web
npm start
```
