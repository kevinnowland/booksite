# Reading list

> __What is this page?__

This page tracks the reading habits of one person.
Not eveything that I read, just the book-like things.
There aren't any magazines or short stories here or individual poems.
No well-researched or half-assed blog posts either. At the core of
this is a _reading list_ which logs the books I've read since late
2021. The date was chosen because that's when I started keeping records
of the books I had finished--the first of many data limitations present
here and which will be discussed more in depth later.

> __But why though?__

Initially I just wanted to record what I had read so that I could better
remember it. I like the idea of being able to, in five years, if I'm still
keeping records somewhere, going back and remembering what a I had read and in
roughly what order.

> __But a website?__

Maybe I'm just vain and want a public record of what I've read in addition
to the list which is in the back of my daily journal.

More prosaically, I wanted to learn React and that meant taking on a 
project and this is what I came up with. Being professionaly involved in
data science but not actually good at data visualization myself, it 
seemed natural to make a page that was oriented around that task as well.
My reading list had been going for about a year which seemed like a decent
starting place for data which I'm naturally interested in.

Over the last few years I have been putting more thought into what I read.
There are too many good books and life isn't long enough. There have been times
when I've tried to alternate fiction and non-fiction--but I like fiction more
and that did not stick. Over the last couple years I try to keep a balance, although
not 50-50, between English and French. I always tell myself to read more poetry
but rarely do. Keeping the reading list has helped me balance my priorities and 
made me a more satisfied reader. Maybe this more complicated reading list will
make me an even more satisfied reader?

For example, I have started to think about who is publishing what I read. Are
they from one of the major publishers or are they an independent publisher?
