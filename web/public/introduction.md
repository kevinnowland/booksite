# Reading list

> __What is this page?__

This page tracks the reading habits of one person.
Not eveything that I read, just the book-like things.
There aren't any magazines or short stories here or individual poems.
No well-researched or half-assed blog posts either. At the core of
this is a _reading list_ which logs the books I've read since late
2021. The date was chosen because that's when I started keeping records
of the books I had finished--the first of many data limitations present
here and which will be discussed more in depth later.

> __But why though?__

Initially I just wanted to record what I had read so that I could better
remember it. I like the idea of being able to, in five years, if I'm still
keeping records somewhere, going back and remembering what a I had read and roughly
what order.

> __But a website?__

Maybe I'm just vain and want a public record of what I've read in addition
to the list which is in the back of my daily journal.

More prosaically, I wanted to learn React and that meant taking on a 
project and this is what I came up with. Being professionaly involved in
data science but not actually good at data visualization myself, it 
seemed natural to make a page that was oriented around that task as well.
My reading list had been going for about a year which seemed like a decent
starting place for data which I'm naturally interested in.

> __I'm going to stop asking you (myself) questions.__

Good idea.

Over the last few years I have been putting more thought into what I read.
There are too many good books and life isn't long enough. There have been times
when I've tried to alternate fiction and non-fiction--but I like fiction more
and that did not stick. Over the last couple years I try to keep a balance, although
not 50-50, between English and French. I always tell myself to read more poetry
but rarely do. Keeping the reading list has helped me balance my priorities and 
made me a more satisfied reader.

The reading list that I keep in my journal is more basic than what is recorded here.
Journal pages are only so large and the list is really just a basic table with each
entry taking up a line and a half at most. Digitally I feel free to record a lot more
and can further interrogate how I read. I live close to Two Dollar Radio HQ in Columbus,
OH which is the store / vegan cafÃ© associated with the independent publisher
named which is itself named Two Dollar Radio, and in the summer of 2022 I made a point
to read several of their books, which got me thinking about whether any other books I 
read are from indie publishing houses. What exactly is the landscape of independent
publishers in my city and around the country? This wasn't a dimension I was tracking
at all on my on-paper reading list, but is a major focus of what I'm keeping track of here.

> __How are publishers represented?__

Except for whether they are independent or not, they are represented poorly. I have
attempted to capture the name... roughly... of the imprint publishing the book as well
as the parent publisher as of 2023. For English language books, independent means not
published by a company which rolls up under the "big five"of Penguin Random House, 
Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Simon and Schuster, or Macmillan. For books published in
France (or elsewhere) I do not have a clear division, although certainly Gallimard is not
independent.

> __What's with the map though?__

Another dimension not represented on my physical reading list is where a book was
purchased. When I travel, I try to stop by an independent book store like my beloved
Book Loft here in Columbus. I can represent this on the map.

That's only so interesting though, as it mostly represents where I've travelled and books
are a great vehicle for exploring places and people that I don't come into physical contact
with. As I started looking into the publishers, I realized just how many books are published
by companies based in New York City. This has to affect what gets published, and I suddenly
had a desire to make sure my reading was derived from sources that are geographically spread
out, both within the US and from abroad.

> __But publisher location isn't author demographics...__

But it can serve at least as some sort of interesting proxy. My goal is not to perfectly
capture the demographics of the US or the world in my reading, just to expand where I read
from and hopefully in so doing also expand the types of books I read. 
I still want the process to be somewhat natural in the sense of its influenced by where 
I'm travelling and what I'm intersted in.

In addition, authorial biographies are much more limited with independently published 
books, so trying to capture author demographics is not easy. Also frought with ethical
issues around identity that require clear answers to be found in interviews or to actually
contact the author and make a personal connection. So I'm (mostly) staying away from gender, 
race, religion, and even age for the most part.
