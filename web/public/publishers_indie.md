I live close to Two Dollar Radio HQ in Columbus,
OH which is the store / vegan cafÃ© associated with the independent publisher
which is itself named Two Dollar Radio, and in the summer of 2022 I made a point
to read several of their books, which got me thinking about whether any other books I 
read are from indie publishing houses. What exactly is the landscape of independent
publishers in my city and around the country? This wasn't a dimension I was tracking
at all on my on-paper reading list, but is a major focus of what I'm keeping track of here.
Journal pages are only so large and the physical list is a basic table with each
entry taking up a line and a half at most. Digitally I am free to record a lot more
and can further interrogate how I read.

> __How are publishers represented?__

Except for whether they are independent or not, they are represented poorly. I have
attempted to capture the name... roughly... of the imprint publishing the book as well
as the parent publisher as of 2023. For English language books, independent means not
published by a company which rolls up under the "big five"of Penguin Random House, 
Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins, Simon and Schuster, and Macmillan. For books published in
France (or elsewhere) I do not have a clear division, although certainly Gallimard is not
independent. The "as of 2023" part is important as well, as many of these imprints have
had parent companies merge and their names might be slightly different than what I've listed;
I don't find myself caring about the different varieties of Tor. I've tried to be more
faithful to the independents, but I'm certain that some of the publishers listed are slightly
wrong for the copy that I've read. Which is to say nothing of whoever the original publisher
was, which I am not recording.

As I started looking into the publishers, I realized just how many books are published
by companies based in New York City. This has to affect what gets published and what stories
get told and by whom, and I suddenly
had a desire to make sure my reading was derived from sources that are geographically spread
out, both within the US and from abroad.
