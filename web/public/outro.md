Sure.

I have chosen not to breakdown scores by any category or even present
changes in scores over time. While I do want to read great books, it seems
overly limiting to say that my reading is a "success" if the scores I give
the books go up over time. For one, I don't trust myself to be consistent since
a score will be terribly subjective and I can see myself getting harsher or easier
with time. If my goal is to read more widely, this should in some sense be challenging
and I don't want to conclude "oh, well, I guess I on average give major publishers
better scores, might as well not read independently published books".
This is not the point and so presenting these aggregations is not in
my interest.

I also did not make a timeline of books by year, which appeals to me visually, but
I have not really made it a point to try to read widely by time period. Since I 
prefer to read contemporary work, this timeline will mostly 
represent how much I've read in a given year, perhaps shifted by 24 months
or something since I prefer to grab paperbacks. In the future this might interest
me either from a coding or broadening horizons perspecitive, but for now,
no timeline.

And that's about it. Feel free to look at the reading list sorted by whatever
dimension.
