Even if I wanted to try to capture something as hard to define as author demographics,
authorial biographies are vague and personal, so trying to capture author demographics in
a systematic way is not easy. It is also frought with ethical
issues around identity that require clear answers, when they exist, to be found in interviews or to actually
contact the author and make a personal connection. So I'm (mostly) staying away from gender, 
race, religion, and even age.

Speaking of gender, I do care a bit about its cognate genre. Although genre boundaries are
permable and artificial, I do read a lot which falls relatively clearly into "science fiction" and I
want to encourage myself to read more genres, and to read things which blur genre
lines and even go between fiction and non-fiction. The genres listed for books have been
decided by me. Apologies to the authors who probably feel otherwise and constrained by
what I've put on their books.
