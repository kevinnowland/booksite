In addition, authorial biographies are much more limited with independently published 
books, so trying to capture author demographics is not easy. Also frought with ethical
issues around identity that require clear answers to be found in interviews or to actually
contact the author and make a personal connection. So I'm (mostly) staying away from gender, 
race, religion, and even age for the most part.

Speaking of gender, I do care a bit about its cognate genre. Although genre boundaries are
permable and artificial, I do read a lot which falls neatly into "science fiction" and I
want to encourage myself to read more genres, and to read things which blur genre
lines and even go between fiction and non-fiction. The genres listed for books have been
decided by me. Apologies to the authors who probably feel otherwise and constrained by
what I've put on their books.
