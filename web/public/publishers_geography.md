> __But publisher location isn't author demographics...__

But it can serve at least as some sort of interesting proxy. My goal is not to perfectly
capture the demographics of the US or the world in my reading, just to expand where I read
from and hopefully in so doing also expand the types of books I read. 
I still want the process to be somewhat natural in the sense of its influenced by where 
I'm travelling and what I'm intersted in. Even with this in mind, it's clear how much
New York City dominates the US-based, English language publishing market.
