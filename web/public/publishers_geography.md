> __But publisher location isn't author demographics...__

Nor does it say anything particularly clear about what the author is trying to say, but 
it serves as some proxy. My goal is not to perfectly
capture the demographics of the US or the world in my reading, just to expand where I read
from and hopefully in so doing also expand the types of books I read. 
I still want the process to be somewhat natural in the sense that it can be influenced by where 
I'm travelling and what I'm intersted in. Even with this in mind, it's clear how much
New York City dominates the US-based, English language publishing market.
