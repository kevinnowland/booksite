> __Anything else?__

Since publishing geography only says so much, another way to branch
out is by language. As mentioned above, I try to keep some balance of
reading between my native English and learned French. But even beyond that,
works in translation help us to push beyond what we are most familiar with. 
(Ugh, terrible sentence, that. Trite.)

Even books that incorporate more than one language tend to have one language
dominate, so that's what's marked down for both the language the
book was read in as well as the language the book was translated from. I do
wonder if that is true everywhere, though. I can imagine a book written in the
United States meant for Spanish speaking audiences which are assumed to also
speak English being split much more evenly between languages. Hopefully I 
can find a book like that one day.
